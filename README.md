# Deep-learning-specialization-projects
This repo has some of the projects from the Deep learning specialization that I completed in late 2020. 
# 1  Neural Style Transfer
In this project I use the Gatys, et al algorithm to transfer styles from some famous paintings such as that of Picasso to real world images. 

# 2 Face recognition and Face verification using deep learning.
Here I use ideas from two popular models FaceNet and Deepface to build two models, one for face verification trained on a public faces dataset. 
Another one for face recognition. Some of the tasks in the project include. 

   #### -> Implement the triplet loss function. 
   #### -> Use a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings. 
   #### -> Use these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition.

# 3 Object detection using YOLO network. 
Here I build the original YOLO network to detect cars in a given image. 
   #### -> Use object detection on a car detection dataset 
   #### -> Deal with bounding boxes
